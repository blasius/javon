# Contributing to Javon

Welcome! Javon is a long-term, community-driven project to build a modern, native-speed programming language with Java-like syntax. Your contributions—big or small—can help shape the future of the language.

## How to Get Started

1. **Read the Roadmap**  
   Check out [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) to see the current tasks and priorities. Start with tasks that match your skills and interests.

2. **Check Existing Issues**  
   Look at open issues on GitHub. Each issue corresponds to a task from the roadmap or a new idea submitted by contributors.

3. **Fork the Repository**  
   Create your own fork of Javon to work on tasks locally.

4. **Create a Branch**  
   Use descriptive names for your branches, e.g., `feature/parser` or `docs/syntax-update`.

5. **Implement and Test**
    - For code contributions: Make sure your changes are tested in `tests/`.
    - For documentation: Ensure clarity, readability, and alignment with the current roadmap.

6. **Submit a Pull Request**
    - Reference the issue or roadmap task your PR addresses.
    - Include a clear description of your changes and any relevant examples.

## Areas Where You Can Contribute

- **Language Design**: Syntax proposals, type system improvements, memory model suggestions.
- **Parser & Interpreter**: Lexer, AST nodes, parser logic, interpreter evaluation.
- **Examples & Tests**: Add programs in `examples/`, unit tests in `tests/`.
- **Documentation**: Improve `docs/` and README clarity, create diagrams or tutorials.
- **Tooling**: Scripts for building, running, or testing prototypes.

## Guidelines for Contributions

- Keep contributions **small and focused** for easier review.
- Follow existing **code style and naming conventions**.
- Comment your code and explain any non-obvious design decisions.
- Be respectful and collaborative in discussions.

---

## Communication

- Use **GitHub Issues** for proposing new features, discussing roadmap tasks, or reporting bugs.
- Participate in discussions and provide feedback on others’ PRs.
