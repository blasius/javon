Javon

A modern, native-speed programming language with Java-like syntax.

Javon is a long-term project for developers who love Java’s familiar syntax but want native performance, safety, and expressiveness. Our goal is to create a language that is fast, modern, and shaped by the community from the ground up.

Vision

Combine Java-like readability with native execution speed.

Provide a safe, modern programming model for high-performance applications.

Build a community-driven language that evolves over time.

Roadmap

Phase 1 – Language Design (Now)

Define core syntax and minimal working features.

Decide on memory model and runtime approach.

Gather ideas and feedback from early contributors.

Phase 2 – Prototype Compiler / Interpreter

Implement basic parser and AST for core syntax.

Compile simple programs to native code.

Build an initial test suite for language features.

Phase 3 – Standard Library & Tooling

Minimal standard library: collections, strings, basic I/O.

CLI compiler tool for developers to run simple programs.

Phase 4 – Community Expansion

Open contribution guidelines.

Develop libraries and modules collaboratively.

Phase 5 – Advanced Features

Generics, advanced type checking, optimizations.

IDE integrations and debugging tools.

How to Contribute

Ideas & Feedback: Suggest language features, syntax changes, or runtime improvements.

Prototyping: Help implement parsers, AST, or small experiments.

Documentation: Improve design documents and roadmap clarity.

Even small contributions—ideas, experiments, or documentation—can shape the future of Javon.
